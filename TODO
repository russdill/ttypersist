* Additional environmental variables

It would be useful to implement options to modify some of the fixed behavior
such as sleep time between re-open attempts.

* Symbolic tty referencing

It might be useful to locate a tty by some symbolic rule, such as:

- Any USB serial adaptor
- An adaptor with a specific model and or serial number

* udev integration

Rather than spinning on the device, it might be better to listen for udev
events. This might fit in well with the symbol tty referencing above.
